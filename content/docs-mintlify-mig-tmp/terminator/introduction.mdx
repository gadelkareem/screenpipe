## overview

**terminator** is an ai-native gui automation sdk that lets ai agents see and control native desktop apps like they were web pages. automate desktop apps like a browser with fast, reliable, agent-ready automation for windows.

because it uses accessibility apis, it is **100x faster and more reliable** for ai computer use than vision-based approaches like openai operator or anthropic computer use.

> **Note:** built for windows with partial macos support.

## benchmarks

the [benchmark test](https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator/blob/main/terminator/src/tests/e2e_tests.rs) illustrates how fast terminator can query the ui. it finds all edit elements in about **80 ms**, showcasing a big speed advantage over vision-based tools.

this [form-filling app](https://www.mediar.ai/) can read & fill forms as soon as you see them in <1s end-to-end using gemini.
